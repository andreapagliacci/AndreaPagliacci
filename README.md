# 👋 Hi, I'm Andrea — Solution Architect & Full-Stack Developer

## 🚀 About Me

I’m a **Solution Architect** with 15+ years of experience designing and delivering software solutions across enterprise systems and startups.

I specialize in building **cloud-native**, **scalable** architectures using Java, Spring Cloud, AWS, Docker, and modern web technologies like **Next.js** and **Angular**.

I believe in **lateral thinking**, seeing the big picture, and writing code that empowers business outcomes. I'm always focused on real-world value, not just technical elegance.

## 🔧 What I'm Working On

### 🧠 AI Assistant with Conversational Modal (RAG-style)

Developed and integrated a conversational AI Assistant (formerly RAG architecture) using **vector embeddings**, **retrieval pipelines**, and **chat modals** to provide contextual help within applications.

- Implemented as a **plugin system** for modular deployment  
- Supports knowledge base ingestion, custom prompts, and multi-turn memory  
- Deployed in SaaS admin panels and client dashboards for enhanced UX

### 🕷 Serverless Web Crawler

Currently developing a serverless crawler using AWS Lambda and S3, while sharing insights on my personal tech blog.

### 🧩 Content Integration Framework (Magnolia CMS + Low Code)

Built a flexible framework to integrate third-party sources (ElasticSearch, AWS S3) into Magnolia CMS with a Low Code approach, enabling fast delivery and extensibility.

### 🧪 End-to-End Testing API

Created an API that simplifies UI testing workflows with a Low Code setup — allowing teams to write, run, and manage tests with minimal friction.

### ☁️ Microservices on AWS

Architected and deployed microservices using **Spring Boot**, **Kafka**, **ElasticSearch**, and **Docker** on **AWS Cloud**.
